<h2>Write Files in Stata Binary Format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Writes the data frame to file in the Stata binary
format.  Does not write array variables unless they can be
<code>drop</code>-ed to a vector.
</p>
<p>Frozen: will not support Stata formats after 10 (aka 11).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
write.dta(dataframe, file, version = 7L,
          convert.dates = TRUE, tz = "GMT",
          convert.factors = c("labels", "string", "numeric", "codes"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dataframe</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string giving filename.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: Stata version: 6, 7, 8 and 10 are supported,
and 9 is mapped to 8, 11 to 10.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>convert.dates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Convert <code>Date</code> and <code>POSIXt</code> objects
to Stata dates?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>timezone for date conversion</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>convert.factors</code></td>

<p>how to handle factors</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The major differences between file formats in Stata versions is that
version 7.0 and later allow 32-character variable names (5 and 6 were
restricted to 8-character name).  The <code>abbreviate</code> function is
used to trim long variables to the permitted length.  A warning is
given if this is needed and it is an error for the abbreviated names
not to be unique.
</p>
<p>The columns in the data frame become variables in the Stata data set.
Missing values are handled correctly.
</p>
<p>Unless deselected by argument <code>convert.dates</code>, <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> date and
date-time objects (<code>POSIXt</code> classes) are converted into the Stata
format.  For date-time objects this may lose information &ndash; Stata
dates are in days since 1960-1-1.  <code>POSIXct</code> objects can be
written without conversion but will not be understood as dates by
Stata; <code>POSIXlt</code> objects cannot be written without conversion.
</p>
<p>There are four options for handling factors.  The default is to use
Stata &lsquo;value labels&rsquo; for the factor levels.  With
<code>convert.factors="string"</code>, the factor levels are written as
strings (the name of the value label is taken from the 
<code>"val.labels"</code> attribute if it exists or the variable name 
otherwise).  With <code>convert.factors="numeric"</code> the numeric values
of the levels are written, or <code>NA</code> if they cannot be coerced to
numeric.  Finally, <code>convert.factors="codes"</code> writes the
underlying integer codes of the factors.  This last used to be the
only available method and is provided largely for backwards
compatibility.
</p>
<p>If the <code>"label.table"</code> contains value labels with names not already 
attached to a variable (not the variable name or name from 
<code>"val.labels"</code>) then these will be written out as well.
</p>
<p>If the <code>"datalabel"</code> attribute contains a string, it is written out
as the dataset label otherwise the dataset label is &quot;Written by R.&quot;.
</p>
<p>If the <code>"expansion.table"</code> attribute exists expansion fields are
written. This attribute should contain a list where each element is 
string vector of length three. The first vector element contains the 
name of a variable or &quot;_dta&quot; (meaning the dataset). The second element
contains the characeristic name. The third contains the associated data.
</p>
<p>If the <code>"val.labels"</code> attribute contains a string vector with a
string label for each variable then this is written as the variable
labels. Otherwise the variable names are repeated as variable labels.
</p>
<p>If the <code>"var.labels"</code> attribute contains a string vector with a
string label for each variable then this is written as the variable
labels. Otherwise the variable names are repeated as variable labels.
</p>
<p>For Stata 8 or later use the default <code>version=7</code> &ndash; the only
advantage of Stata 8 format is that it can represent multiple
different missing value types, and <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> doesn't have them.  Stata 10/11
allows longer format lists, but <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> does not make use of them.
</p>
<p>Note that the Stata formats are documented to use ASCII strings &ndash;
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> does not enforce this, but use of non-ASCII character strings will
not be portable as the encoding is not recorded.  Up to 244 bytes are
allowed in character data, and longer strings will be truncated with a
warning.
</p>
<p>Stata uses some large numerical values to represent missing
values.  This function does not currently check, and hence integers
greater than <code>2147483620</code> and doubles greater than
<code>8.988e+307</code> may be misinterpreted by Stata.
